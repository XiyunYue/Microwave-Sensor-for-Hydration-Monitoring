# Introduction
Master thesis project - Microwave Sensor for Hydration Monitoring

The main focus lies in human's boday modeling and analyzing the influence of various parameters on the output signal. Following thorough theoretical data analysis, simulation results are obtained using CST software. Finally, a foundational antenna is established for measurement purposes, and actual data variations collected using Vector Network Analyzers (VNA) are utilized for comparative analysis. For more details, refer (https://github.com/XiyunYue/project/blob/main/Master_thesis_presentation.pptx)

The data comparison is in the 'cst' folder, with each folder having different analysis done in a MATLAB file.( For Example: https://github.com/XiyunYue/project/blob/main/cst/CST_dipole_230123_cst/main.m), and the model analysis code  is in the 'analyze' folder with different kind of layers. ( For example: https://github.com/XiyunYue/project/blob/main/analyze/3layer/code_new_without_real/code_input.m).
