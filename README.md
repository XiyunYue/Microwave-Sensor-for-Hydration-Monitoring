# Introduction
The work done about my Master thesis project at Trinity College Dublin.

The main focus lies in human's boday modeling and analyzing the influence of various parameters on the output signal. Following thorough theoretical data analysis, simulation results are obtained using CST software. Finally, a foundational antenna is established for measurement purposes, and actual data variations collected using Vector Network Analyzers (VNA) are utilized for comparative analysis.
